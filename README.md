# van-der-pol-matlab-runge-kutta-4
Plotting the van der Pol equation using Runge-Kutta 4th Order method on Matlab
<br>
<br> Please note that I set it so h=0.1 ; μ ϵ {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5}; t ϵ [0,35]
<br> I first changed the ODE to first order ODE before applying Runge-Kutta and solve it numerically.
